we try to implement the following commits in libfuse in go-fuse:

	https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/commit/5c094ac0150ebfef6a2c9c2c9d1c545a90ff4e96
	https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/commit/555d6b504308eac6b976321ce938ee4bec62c354

	i don't think we wanna add this commit:
		https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/commit/28bdae3d113ef479c1660a581ef720cdc33bf466 (???)


core code in libfuse where commas are escaped:
	inside the function `add_opt_common`:

	https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/db35a37de/lib/fuse_opt.c

so it only happens if 'esc' (=escape) is true

=> then there are two functions:

- fuse_opt_add_opt
- fuse_opt_add_opt_escaped

the first function is called if we want to add an option which shouldn't be escapd
the second function is called if we want to add an option which should be escapd

Those functions are called in mount.c/fuse_mount_opt_proc

	https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/dba6b3983/lib/mount.c#L187-L216

	=> for fusermount options they always use 'fuse_opt_add_opt_escaped'
	=> so it seems to be safe to escape any option, because in this patch
           it's only about fusermount options anyway

which on the other hand is called here (it's passed as 'proc'):

	https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/db35a37def14b72181f3630efeea0e0433103c41/lib/fuse_opt.c#L398-L423
